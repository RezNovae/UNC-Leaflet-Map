# UNC Leaflet Map
UNC Georeference Map

https://reznovae.github.io/UNC-Leaflet-Map/

This leaflet map requires the use of GIS and html. The aerial photo is overlayed to the Open Street Maps to show how photographs are not accurate and needs to be modified to meet modern standards. GIS is used to modify the photograph to match modern streets and to show the difference between the past and present UNC. HTML is used to tie both maps together into layered maps.
